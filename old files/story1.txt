Once upon a time, a young man named Sunan was traveling aimlessly when he came upon an old beggar at the side of a lonely road. Sunan's heart went out to the man. He stopped and said, “Sir, I have little, but I wish to share my bread and water with you. Eat heartily.”
The beggar ate, and when he was finished, Sunan bowed and prepared to leave, but the man seized his hand. “Wait, I wish to thank you properly for your generosity. I offer you a magic spell that will be useful to you.”
