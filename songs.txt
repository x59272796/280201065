stairway to heaven
enjoy the silence
personal jesus
strangelove
world in my eyes
when the levee breaks
stripped
are friends electric
mayonaise
der kommissar
interstate love song
condemnation
beetlebum
cherub rock
feel good inc.
borderline
i just called to say i love you
the less i know the better
never let me down again
remember the time
coffee and tv
i feel you
every planet we reach is dead
take my breath away
my heart can't tell me no
